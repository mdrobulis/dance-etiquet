## Preparation for the event

General rule is, better looking people are liked more, dance more. Their

Here are some things to boost your first impression.

### Control your Odors

You'll be very close to other people. So close, you can smell the brand of shampoo they use and what's ther favorite flavour of coffee.
If you can smell them, they can smell you. 

Rule 1: Shower before event. Avoid weird smelling products. 
Rule 2: Use deodorant. Have it everywhere: shower, bedroom, by the door, in your car, purse, backpack.

Optional : Parfume. Great thing, but use it with caution. Too much and your parner is stuck breathing it for 5 minutes.

### Haircut

The unsung hero of the hot guy look is his barber. Same goes for the girls.
Seriously, sharpen your hair every 3 weeks at least. 
It will add a lot of points to your attractiveness.

### Clothing 

Rule 1) Avoid clothing with sharp decour.
Rule 2) Always have a spare set or two of cloths to sweat through.
Optional : Match the theme of the party

Depending on your intention for the party you should dress accordingly.
For a sport of dancing all the dances, choose sth practical and comfortable. Also have extra t-shirts and a towel.
 socialization, classy shirt / proper dress works well. 


### Fighting the sweat

General Tips:
- Use deodorant
- Take breaks, dance every other song.
- Use execive amounts of deodorant
- Have extra shits/dresses
- Hand fan for the ladies. Most elegant way to keep cool.
- Small pocket towel for men.
- Drink less water. If you dance hard and drink buckets of water, your body will manage heat by rivers of sweat a.k.a. hyperperspiration.

Usualy the dance floor is pretty hot place. 
Guys dont usualy mind sweat, but girls do.
Less cloths - more comfort for you. But your dance partners may feel your soaking wet t-shirt and run away screaming (and/or never dance with you... ever).
Thicker cloths absorb more sweat, but make you sweat more. 

So find your balance.

## Lay of the land

DJ's table - All the cools kids are there. It's the inner circle of the community.
Teachers, invited guests and the best dancers hang there. 

Chairs at the perifery - People go to rest, drink and socialize here.
Its is not the best place to look for a dance partner. 

The standing circle around the dance floor - A very dynamic place where people are looking to dance.
Thats were you wait for the girl you want to dance with or watch your favorite dancer execute their perfect moves.

By the entrence door - Beginners usually don't feel comfortable venturing deep into the room.
You'll find your aquaintances from the beginners class here.

This is not always true, but a general trend. Take it with a grain of salt.

## Invitation

The perfect moment to invite someone is between the songs.
The person may have just finished a dance with someone else and walking back to 

### Eyes are the mirror of the soul

When you arrive at a party look arriund. You will naturaly see the people who you want to dance with
If you see a guy/girl staring at you, they probably want to dance.
Look back and smile. If they maintain the gaze you can approach and take them to the dance floor.

This interaction can be devoid of words.

### Approach.

Never from the back. Even if you know the person, it can startle him/her.
Remember the standing circle, whats where you'll find people excited to dance with you.

Just catching eye contact, smile and extending the hand is enough to imply your intention to share a dance.
You don't have to introduce your self before asking for a dance. You can do it after the dance.

### The Dance

1. Smile (Clean your teeth before ofc.)
2. Try and feel your partners body, his/her weight and balance.  
3. Watch the dance floor. You too ladies, your partner doesn't have eyes on the back of his head. Colisions are never fun.
4. Never trust your partner to catch your balance. Hold your own.
5. Feel the music. Slow music demands big, slow movements. Fast music wants small and quick steps.

### The end

When the music fades, watch your partners eyes.
A) They are locked on you - you may suggest round 2.
B) They are looking for someone else - you may say thank you. 

Its nice to guide the lady off the crowded dance floor. Leave her where you found. 

### LifeHacks

## Saying NO

Should you say NO? No, you should say THANK YOU. Its polite, it still gets the message accross.

Why? 
Its better for both of you.
Trust me, you don't want to dance with someone who does not want to dance with you. Its degrading.

Do you have to explain your self?
- Absolutely not

Should you? 
- Depends. 
If its sth that the person can change (smell, sweat, bad breth, too much hair, sharp bracelets), you can.
If you say it respectfully, the person will be greatfull to you forever.  
If his/her face annoyes you, keep it to your self. Or...
Use one of these generic excuses 
- Im tired.
- My feet hurt.
- I need to cool down.
- I need water.
- Im going to bathroom.
- Im all sweaty, i need to change. 
- I promissed a dance to someone else.

Sometimes they are true. You'll never know, 
unless you hear these magic words 
- "Find me after this song"

## Hearing No

It's never fun and it hurts. Always. 
It's not always about you. 

Should you try again? - Depends
